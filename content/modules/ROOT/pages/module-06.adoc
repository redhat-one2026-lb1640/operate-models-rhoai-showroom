In moments, the Forge produced a new seeing-stone, a retrained model.
 But Aerendil knew that Sauron's malice was not limited to the battlefield. The Dark Lord's servants could weave whispers of corruption into the very fabric of data. Aerendil initiated a Spell of Warding, a deep scan of the entire process. "From the first line of code to the final artifact, no shadow must pass," he declared. (He was hardening the model and verifying the integrity of the entire AIML software supply chain to protect against threats from Mordor's offensive cyber operators).
 
 == What you will accomplish in this module:

* Look through the CICD pipeline results (scans, etc)
* Threat hunting against the built model
* Check for adherance to security, ZT, supply chain, etc policies

== Step 1

* example the CICD verification pipeline run and each individual task


== Step 2

* access the kestrel appliance a backend
	
* pint kestrel at the model
* review the kestrel scan results for any anomalies or issues


== Step 3

* review the conformance policies from the EC/conforma rules that are applied 
* run a policy check pipeline against the built model
* review the policy check results for any violations or issues

== What you accomplished in this module

* Thing 1
* Thing 2
* Thing 3
