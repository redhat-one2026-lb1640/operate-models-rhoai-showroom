== Motivation


AI will change how we live, work, and experience our everyday lives. 
In this hands-on lab, participants get a last of the tools that will power this future. 
We will use Openshift AI, Red Hats AIML platform based on OpenShift Container Platform to create models and deploy these to production quality.

In an era where adversaries are increasingly using AI to evade detection, security teams must leverage advanced platforms to deploy, manage, and secure their own AI capabilities at speed and scale.
 This session demonstrates how Red Hat OpenShift AI empowers teams to rapidly transition from experimental models in a Jupyter Workbench to production-grade deployments—while embedding security throughout the lifecycle.
 
 We will walk through a complete AI Threat Hunting use case
 * starting with data exploration and model development inside OpenShift AI Workbench
 * moving to model packaging and deployment as an API service, and finally applying Zero Trust principles to protect both the model and its data.
 * Attendees will see how to integrate role-based access controls (RBAC), network isolation, and model observability for compliance and operational safety. 
 
 
 Key takeaways include: 
 
 * How to use OpenShift AI Workbench for rapid iteration on security-focused models.
 * Best practices for securing AI endpoints and pipelines against adversarial attacks.
 * Applying OpenShift-native monitoring and governance to sustain trust in AI-powered threat hunting. 
 * Whether you are a data scientist, security engineer, or platform architect, you will leave with a clear blueprint for securely operationalizing AI models in mission-critical environments.


== Introduction

== What does Operationalize mean?



=== Production hardening

production hardening of AI systems for operations means we need to prepare our architecture, infrastructure, and processes to ensure that AI models can be deployed, monitored, and maintained effectively in a production environment. This involves several key aspects:
* Scalability: Ensuring that the AI systems can handle increased workloads and user demands without performance degradation.
* Reliability: Implementing robust systems that can operate continuously with minimal downtime and can recover quickly from failures.
* Security: Protecting AI models and data from unauthorized access, tampering, and adverse attacks.

== You are the city manager!

In this lab, _you will act the role of a typical city manager_, embarking down the path of a building a smart city. Like a lot of cities, you have too many cars on the road and too much traffic. Your city council and constituents have been calling and demanding you provide a plan to reduce traffic. Plus you are trying to make your city more pedestrian friendly to reduce the number of pedestrian injuries and promote economic activity in local commercial districts.

As a first step, you want to understand traffic in your city and are decide to deploy some smart sensors to measure traffic throughout your street grid. A common type of smart device for this purpose is a traffic light camera:

.Another common type traffic light camera

Once you are collecting data, you can start simulating scenarios that you can use to plan your traffic signals and timing to improve the flow of traffic, reduce average speeds, accommodate busy pedestrian intersections.

== Github

This lab may require you to create a link:github.com[github] user account, if you did not already have one. This is free and quick and simple to set up. If you do already have an account , go there now and set one up.

== Login and get started

For this introduction lab, we will introduce you to some of the tools you will be using for the remained of the modules.

You should have been assigned a user name by your instructor, `user1…​userN`

For today you are {user} — while many of the following lab sections will automatically configure this for you, keep on eye on things and make sure it is correct. If you notice a problem, you may be able to manually correct the to the correct user or flag a facilitator for assistance.

First thing you should do is navigate to the starting page for your user — we refer to this as your "showroom" and it should look something like this:

.Your initial showroom environment
image::/intro-lab-initial-user-showroom.png["Your initial showroom environment"]

TIP: We also recommend logging into the terminal in this showroom environment; you may be asked to run command in this during the course of your workshop. In this terminal enter `{login_command}` to login.

Then log into your link:https://{openshift_console_url}[OpenShift Container Platform web console^]. Your user name is `{user}` and your password is `openshift`  .

== Accessing OpenShift AI

In the OpenShift Console, click on the  image:/100002010000003000000024AAAC041571052865.png["apps button"] at the top, image:intro-initial-openshift-console.png["The banner navigation buttons"] then click image:/intro-Openshift-AI-application.png[the OpenShift AI option] to log into OpenShift AI. If you are presented with an access authorization page, click the button to image:/10000201000000A000000020B028AB197DEBE3A3.png["Login to OpenShift"] / This should log you into OpenShift AI.

Once you are in OpenShift AI, click on the menu button image:/100002010000002E000000216426608B65255A13.png[the menu button] in the left navigation pane, and locate and then click on the image:/10000201000000B200000027F58611BB363F3154.png[the data science projects button].

IMPORTANT: The project selection is non-standard; read these instructions carefully

If you are presented with a screen stating `No data science projects yet` , *DO NOT* select the Create data science project button

image::intro-create-data-science-project.png[Create data science project button]

Your project *MAY* have already been created for you. You will need to select:

image::/install-datascience-projects.png[ the project type selector ]

and then

image::/install-datascience-all-projects.png[ the All project option ]

You should see a number of projects shown; find the project `{user}-city` and select this project. *IF* this project does not exist, then select the image:intro-create-data-science-project-button.png[Create data science project button] to create a new project, and name this project `{user}-city`. Do not get creative with the name, as later parts of this lab will depend on this name.

Create a new OpenShift AI Workbench by click image:/100002010000009100000021A1D82C0B6349F1C3.png[the Create Workbench button]. Name this workbench `{user}-workbench` . If you want to add creativity, do so in the description! This *is required* for you to stay consistent with the rest of the lab.

For Image selection, choose image:/100002010000007B0000003FA29A900E8890D587.png[Minimal Python]. You can leave the rest of the fields as the default. At the very bottom, click image:/1000020100000091000000211148800178F97C50.png[the Create Workbench button] .

After a minute or two, you should see the workbench change from image:/10000201000000460000002FDF0FBBBC61A6E1C5.png[starting] to image:/100002010000003A00000030BD8223197D20CCFD.png[running] .

Once `running`, you should be able to access your OpenShift AI Workbench by clicking on the image:/100002010000004200000023E46306A5CE3ADC98.png[open] link to open your new OpenShift AI Workbench.

If presented with an authorization request, you will need to authorize yourself access to your workbench. Click  image:/10000201000000A000000020B028AB197DEBE3A3.png[the Log in with OpenShift ] button to proceed.

Helpful tips for running the commands in this notebook
There are several commands that are written into this notebook that can be run directly in the notebook.

In general you can move through notebooks in order, and we recommend reading the text of each proceeeding cell to understand what is going on. Follow in order and click on the commands provided; you can press [ Shift ] + [ Enter ] to execute these command cells.

You can use the arrow keys to move to the next section of the notebook.

In some cases you will need or want to open a Terminal inside your OpenShift AI Workbench to load the course resources. There are many ways to open a terminal, but here is one that always works: at the top of the notebook interface, click image:/100002010000002300000017A7751A2F8CB5671D.png[ the File menu] then image:/100002010000002800000016B63989EE943480F7.png[the new option], and finally the image:/100002010000004D00000018604E6A830090C94F.png[the terminal option].

NOTE: We recommend leaving this terminal open during the this lab. You will be asked to execute commands in it.
