"Direct hit!" Bereg's triumphant cry was the signal Aerendil awaited. The canary had sung. Now, he began the full rollout. He commanded the Forge to perform an A/B test, deploying the new model to half the launchers on the wall while the other half retained the old. The results were stark. One data-stream showed continued failure; the other, a cascade of successful target locks. (The A/B test provided live, comparative data proving the new model's effectiveness).
