The model was clean, but Aerendil was cautious. A full deployment could be disastrous if some unseen flaw remained. He would send the update to a single unit first—to Captain Bereg's company. "Let one arrow fly before we empty the quiver," he thought. This was a Canary Deployment, a small test to prove the solution in the heart of the battle. A single thread of light shot from his tower across the plains to the ruins of Osgiliath, carrying the precious update.
