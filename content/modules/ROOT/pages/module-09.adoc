With the new model's superiority proven, the time had come. Aerendil initiated the final phase: a Blue-Green Deployment. He activated a fully parallel system—the "Green"—running the new model. Then, with a single, silent command, he rerouted the entire defensive network from the old "Blue" system to the new. The switch was instantaneous. Not a single launcher went offline; there was no break in the shield wall. The Forge's power scaled seamlessly, meeting the demands of total war.
