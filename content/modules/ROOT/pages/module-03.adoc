In the high chambers of the Tower of Ecthelion, where the winds of the world could be heard 
sighing against ancient stone, Aerendil kept his watch.
He was a Loremaster of the Integrated Cortex, and though he bore no sword, his mind was the sharpest weapon in the White City of Minas Tirith. 
Before him, a console of polished obsidian and mithril glowed, not with fire, but with the light of a thousand flowing runes—the lifeblood of Gondor's defense.
For in this age, the might of Man was wedded to the logic of the Machine Spirit, an advanced AI, and Aerendil was its master and guardian.
