A frantic message, carried on waves of thought, arrived from the front lines at Osgiliath. It was from Captain Bereg, a grim veteran. "The Eagles have been blinded!" he cried, his voice strained. The 'Eagle's Eye' launchers, Gondor's newest automated anti-Oliphaunt defenses, were failing. "The enemy has wrought some new sorcery! The towers upon the backs of the Mûmakil shimmer with a fell light, a shifting pattern that our seeing-stones cannot comprehend. The targeting locks break like glass!" (The computer vision AI used by the launchers could no longer identify its target).</p>


== What you will accomplish in this module:

* Receive tips and warnings from users about problems with your AIML model (send a "bad image", it fires an alert)
* Collect fresh data from your users that you will use to retrain and tune your model (labeling)
* Manually analyze the data and assess that you will need to update your model (identifications that previously worked are now failing)

== Step 1

You are manually watching the model performance on a dashboard/raw logs/some other indicator and observe that the model accuracy is degrading over time.


Do Stuff

== Step 2

* nice to have -- a custom RHOAI model accuracy alert that notifies the mission operator that the model accuracy has fallen below an acceptable threshold

Do Stuff

* "wait" for additional data to come in from the field -- additional observations from the users and photos of targets that the model is not identifying correctly.
* look at a S2 bucket or other data store where the "bad images" are being collected for later analysis and labeling.

== Step 3

* set up a new model training job using the newly labeled data to improve the model accuracy and performance.
* load a new pipeline to retrain the model using the new data collected from the field. (the pipeline will have been pre-built and is just being triggered here).
* poof exbake oven, model training is already done!
